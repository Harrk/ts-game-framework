# Typescript Game Framework

A work in progress game framework written in Typescript. Not fit for use in any way. Merely an educational project for myself.

**Structure/names of classes are likely to change whilst in development.**

## Setting Up
**Install Packages**
```bash
$ yarn
```

**Run Project**
```bash
yarn run dev
```

**Build**

yarn run build
```

## Todo List

List will change over time as I learn more about what systems make up a game framework.
