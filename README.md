# Typescript Game Framework

A work in progress game framework written in Typescript. 
Not fit for use in any way: I do not know what I am doing, as this is an excuse to familiarise myself with Typescript.

There is currently no documentation on how to use the framework, so it is the wild-west out here.

**Structure/names of classes are likely to change whilst in development.**

## Using the Package
```bash
$ yarn add https://github.com/Harrk/ts-game-framework
```

### Demos
[Squares](https://github.com/Harrk/tsgfw-square-demo)

## Package Development
**Install Packages**
```bash
$ yarn
```

**Code Linter**

Check code changes follows the styleguide:
```bash
yarn lint
```

## Todo List

List will change over time as I learn more about what systems make up a game framework.
